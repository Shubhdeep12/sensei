/**
 * SYMBOL EXTRACTOR
 * 
 * ROLE: Extracts symbols (functions, classes, variables) from code for indexing
 * 
 * LANGUAGE STRATEGY:
 * - CORE LANGUAGES (JS/TS/Python/HTML/CSS/JSON/YAML): Full Tree-sitter symbol extraction
 * - SECONDARY LANGUAGES (Everything else): Basic symbol extraction with limited parsing
 * 
 * IMPORTS:
 * - ProcessedFile from shared/types
 * - ASTNode from shared/types
 * - Tree-sitter parsers for core languages only
 * - Language-specific symbol extractors
 * - Content-based analyzers for secondary languages
 * 
 * EXPORTS:
 * - SymbolExtractor class
 * - Language-specific symbol extraction methods
 * - Symbol validation utilities
 * 
 * PROCESS:
 * 1. Categorizes files by language priority (core/secondary)
 * 2. CORE LANGUAGES: Full Tree-sitter AST traversal + comprehensive symbol extraction
 * 3. SECONDARY LANGUAGES: Basic AST parsing + limited symbol extraction + content analysis
 * 4. Builds unified symbol index with different quality levels per language
 * 
 * CORE LANGUAGE SYMBOL EXTRACTION (JS/TS/Python/HTML/CSS/JSON/YAML):
 * - Full AST traversal with Tree-sitter
 * - Comprehensive symbol metadata extraction
 * - Relationship detection (inheritance, composition, dependencies)
 * - Cross-reference resolution
 * - Documentation extraction (JSDoc, docstrings, comments)
 * 
 * SECONDARY LANGUAGE SYMBOL EXTRACTION (Java/Go/PHP/Rust/C#/Ruby/etc):
 * - Basic AST parsing where possible
 * - Limited symbol metadata extraction
 * - Simple relationship detection
 * - Content-based documentation extraction
 * - Pattern-based symbol detection
 * 
 * SYMBOL TYPES EXTRACTED (by language priority):
 * - CORE: Functions, classes, variables, imports, exports, constants, enums, interfaces, types
 * - SECONDARY: Functions, classes, variables, imports, exports (limited)
 * 
 * SYMBOL METADATA (quality varies by language):
 * - Name: Symbol name
 * - Type: Function, class, variable, etc.
 * - Location: File path, line, column
 * - Signature: Function signature or type definition (core languages only)
 * - Scope: Global, module, class, function
 * - Visibility: Public, private, protected (core languages only)
 * - Documentation: Associated comments/docstrings
 * - Dependencies: What this symbol depends on (core languages only)
 * - Dependents: What depends on this symbol (core languages only)
 * - Quality: High (core), Medium (secondary)
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * - Called by AnalysisProcessor for symbol extraction
 * - Input: ProcessedFile[] with content from Discovery (ALL file types)
 * - Output: SymbolIndex with different quality levels per language
 * - Used by dependency mapping and code chunking
