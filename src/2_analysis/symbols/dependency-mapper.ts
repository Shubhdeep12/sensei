/**
 * DEPENDENCY MAPPER
 * 
 * ROLE: Maps code dependencies and relationships for context understanding
 * 
 * IMPORTS:
 * - SymbolIndex from shared/types
 * - ParsedFile from shared/types
 * - Dependency analysis algorithms
 * 
 * EXPORTS:
 * - DependencyMapper class
 * - Dependency mapping methods
 * - Relationship analysis utilities
 * 
 * PROCESS:
 * 1. Analyzes symbol usage and references
 * 2. Maps import/export relationships
 * 3. Identifies function calls and method invocations
 * 4. Builds dependency graph for context
 * 5. Detects circular dependencies and issues
 * 
 * DEPENDENCY TYPES:
 * - Import Dependencies: What imports what
 * - Export Dependencies: What exports what
 * - Usage Dependencies: What uses what
 * - Inheritance Dependencies: Class inheritance
 * - Composition Dependencies: Object composition
 * - Interface Dependencies: Interface implementations
 * - Type Dependencies: Type usage and definitions
 * - Call Dependencies: Function/method calls
 * 
 * DEPENDENCY METADATA:
 * - Source: Where the dependency comes from
 * - Target: What it depends on
 * - Type: Import, export, usage, inheritance
 * - Weight: Strength of dependency
 * - Direction: One-way or bidirectional
 * - Context: Where the dependency is used
 * - Frequency: How often it's used
 * 
 * DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS:
 * - Build dependency graph from symbols
 * - Identify critical dependencies
 * - Detect circular dependencies
 * - Find orphaned symbols
 * - Analyze dependency depth
 * - Identify dependency clusters
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * - Called by AnalysisProcessor after symbol extraction
 * - Input: SymbolIndex from SymbolExtractor
 * - Output: DependencyGraph with all relationships
 * - Used by code chunking and context building
