/**
 * FEATURE DETECTOR
 * 
 * ROLE: Detects code features and capabilities for better context
 * 
 * IMPORTS:
 * - CodeChunk from shared/types
 * - SymbolIndex from shared/types
 * - Feature detection algorithms
 * 
 * EXPORTS:
 * - FeatureDetector class
 * - Feature detection methods
 * - Feature classification utilities
 * 
 * PROCESS:
 * 1. Analyzes code chunks for features and capabilities
 * 2. Identifies API endpoints, functions, and methods
 * 3. Detects data models and schemas
 * 4. Identifies configuration and settings
 * 5. Maps features to business capabilities
 * 
 * FEATURE TYPES:
 * - API Endpoints: REST, GraphQL, RPC endpoints
 * - Data Models: Classes, interfaces, schemas
 * - Business Logic: Core functionality
 * - Utilities: Helper functions and tools
 * - Configuration: Settings and config
 * - Tests: Test code and examples
 * - Documentation: Comments and docs
 * - Error Handling: Error management
 * - Validation: Input validation
 * - Authentication: Security features
 * 
 * FEATURE METADATA:
 * - Name: Feature name
 * - Type: API, model, utility, etc.
 * - Description: What the feature does
 * - Parameters: Input parameters
 * - Returns: Output/return values
 * - Dependencies: What it depends on
 * - Usage: How it's used
 * - Examples: Usage examples
 * - Tests: Associated tests
 * 
 * FEATURE DETECTION:
 * - Analyze function names and signatures
 * - Identify API patterns and conventions
 * - Detect data model structures
 * - Find configuration patterns
 * - Identify test patterns
 * - Map business capabilities
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * - Called by AnalysisProcessor after chunking
 * - Input: CodeChunk[] with code segments
 * - Output: FeatureMap with detected features
 * - Used by metadata enrichment and context building
