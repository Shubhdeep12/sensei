/**
 * BUG PATTERN DETECTOR
 * 
 * ROLE: Detects potential bugs and issues in code for better context
 * 
 * IMPORTS:
 * - CodeChunk from shared/types
 * - SymbolIndex from shared/types
 * - Bug detection patterns and rules
 * 
 * EXPORTS:
 * - BugPatternDetector class
 * - Bug detection methods
 * - Bug severity assessment
 * 
 * PROCESS:
 * 1. Analyzes code chunks for common bug patterns
 * 2. Identifies potential issues and vulnerabilities
 * 3. Assesses bug severity and impact
 * 4. Provides bug context and explanations
 * 5. Tracks bug patterns across codebase
 * 
 * BUG PATTERNS:
 * - Null Pointer: Potential null reference errors
 * - Memory Leaks: Unreleased resources
 * - Race Conditions: Concurrency issues
 * - Buffer Overflows: Array bounds violations
 * - Type Errors: Type mismatches and errors
 * - Logic Errors: Incorrect logic implementation
 * - Performance Issues: Inefficient algorithms
 * - Security Vulnerabilities: Security flaws
 * 
 * BUG DETECTION:
 * - Pattern matching for common bugs
 * - Static analysis for potential issues
 * - Code smell detection
 * - Anti-pattern identification
 * - Vulnerability scanning
 * - Performance issue detection
 * 
 * BUG METADATA:
 * - Bug Type: What kind of bug
 * - Severity: Critical, high, medium, low
 * - Impact: What could go wrong
 * - Location: Where the bug is
 * - Context: Surrounding code context
 * - Fix: Suggested fix or workaround
 * - Examples: Similar bugs in codebase
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * - Called by AnalysisProcessor after feature detection
 * - Input: CodeChunk[] with features
 * - Output: BugPattern[] with detected bugs and metadata
 * - Used by metadata enrichment and quality assessment
