/**
 * CONTEXT BUILDER
 *
 * ROLE: Builds rich context for code chunks to improve retrieval and understanding
 *
 * IMPORTS:
 * - CodeChunk from shared/types
 * - SymbolIndex from shared/types
 * - DependencyGraph from shared/types
 * - Context analysis algorithms
 *
 * EXPORTS:
 * - ContextBuilder class
 * - Context building methods
 * - Context optimization utilities
 *
 * PROCESS:
 * 1. Analyzes code chunks for context requirements
 * 2. Builds surrounding code context
 * 3. Adds dependency and relationship context
 * 4. Enriches chunks with metadata context
 * 5. Optimizes context for embedding and retrieval
 *
 * CONTEXT TYPES:
 * - Code Context: Surrounding code and structure
 * - Dependency Context: What this chunk depends on
 * - Usage Context: How this chunk is used
 * - Semantic Context: What this chunk does
 * - File Context: File-level information
 * - Project Context: Project-level information
 *
 * CONTEXT BUILDING:
 * - Analyze chunk boundaries and relationships
 * - Extract surrounding code context
 * - Map dependency relationships
 * - Identify usage patterns
 * - Add semantic descriptions
 * - Include file and project metadata
 *
 * CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION:
 * - Ensure context is relevant and useful
 * - Avoid context bloat and noise
 * - Maintain context consistency
 * - Optimize for embedding size
 * - Preserve important relationships
 *
 * USAGE:
 * - Called by AnalysisProcessor after code chunking
 * - Input: CodeChunk[] from CodeChunker
 * - Output: Enriched CodeChunk[] with rich context
 * - Used by embedding generation and retrieval
