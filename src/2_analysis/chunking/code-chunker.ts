/**
 * CODE CHUNKER
 * 
 * ROLE: Creates intelligent code chunks for embedding and retrieval
 * 
 * LANGUAGE STRATEGY:
 * - CORE LANGUAGES (JS/TS/Python/HTML/CSS/JSON/YAML): Semantic-aware chunking with AST understanding
 * - SECONDARY LANGUAGES (Everything else): Structure-based chunking with limited parsing
 * 
 * IMPORTS:
 * - ProcessedFile from shared/types (ALL file types)
 * - SymbolIndex from shared/types (varies by language)
 * - DependencyGraph from shared/types (core languages only)
 * - Language-specific chunking strategies
 * - Content-based chunking for secondary languages
 * 
 * EXPORTS:
 * - CodeChunker class
 * - Language-specific chunking methods
 * - Chunk optimization utilities
 * 
 * PROCESS:
 * 1. Categorizes files by language priority (core/secondary)
 * 2. CORE LANGUAGES: Semantic-aware chunking using AST and symbol information
 * 3. SECONDARY LANGUAGES: Structure-based chunking with limited parsing + content analysis
 * 4. Optimizes chunks for embedding while preserving context
 * 
 * CORE LANGUAGE CHUNKING (JS/TS/Python/HTML/CSS/JSON/YAML):
 * - Semantic-aware chunking using AST understanding
 * - Function-based, class-based, and module-based strategies
 * - Context preservation with surrounding code
 * - Dependency-aware chunking
 * - Intelligent boundary detection
 * 
 * SECONDARY LANGUAGE CHUNKING (Java/Go/PHP/Rust/C#/Ruby/etc):
 * - Structure-based chunking with limited parsing
 * - Function and class boundary detection
 * - Basic context preservation
 * - Size-optimized chunking
 * - Content-based chunking for non-parsable files
 * 
 * CHUNKING STRATEGIES (by language priority):
 * - CORE: Function-based, class-based, module-based, semantic-based, context-based
 * - SECONDARY: Function-based, class-based, size-based, content-based
 * 
 * CHUNK TYPES (varies by language):
 * - CORE: Function chunks, class chunks, module chunks, feature chunks, bug chunks, test chunks
 * - SECONDARY: Function chunks, class chunks, module chunks, content chunks, data chunks
 * 
 * CHUNK METADATA (quality varies by language):
 * - Type: Function, class, module, content, etc.
 * - Size: Number of lines and characters
 * - Context: Surrounding code context (core languages only)
 * - Dependencies: What this chunk depends on (core languages only)
 * - Dependents: What depends on this chunk (core languages only)
 * - Features: What features this chunk implements
 * - Bugs: Potential issues in this chunk (core languages only)
 * - Tests: Associated test code
 * - Documentation: Related documentation
 * - Quality: High (core), Medium (secondary)
 * 
 * CHUNK OPTIMIZATION (by language priority):
 * - CORE: Complete logical units, context preservation, relationship maintenance
 * - SECONDARY: Basic logical units, limited context preservation, size optimization
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * - Called by AnalysisProcessor after symbol extraction
 * - Input: ProcessedFile[] with content from Discovery (ALL file types)
 * - Output: CodeChunk[] with different quality levels per language
 * - Used by embedding generation and retrieval
