/**
 * EMBEDDING VALIDATOR
 *
 * ROLE: Validates embedding quality and consistency for reliable retrieval
 *
 * IMPORTS:
 * - VectorEmbedding from shared/types
 * - Validation algorithms and metrics
 * - Quality assessment tools
 *
 * EXPORTS:
 * - EmbeddingValidator class
 * - Validation methods
 * - Quality assessment utilities
 *
 * PROCESS:
 * 1. Validates embedding quality and consistency
 * 2. Checks for embedding errors and issues
 * 3. Assesses retrieval performance
 * 4. Identifies problematic embeddings
 * 5. Provides quality improvement recommendations
 *
 * VALIDATION CHECKS:
 * - Vector Validity: Valid vector format and values
 * - Dimensionality: Correct vector dimensions
 * - Magnitude: Appropriate vector magnitudes
 * - Similarity: Semantic similarity preservation
 * - Consistency: Consistent embedding quality
 *
 * QUALITY METRICS:
 * - Cosine Similarity: Similarity between related vectors
 * - Euclidean Distance: Distance between vectors
 * - Clustering Quality: How well vectors cluster
 * - Retrieval Precision: Accuracy of retrieval
 * - Retrieval Recall: Completeness of retrieval
 *
 * USAGE:
 * - Called by EmbeddingProcessor after optimization
 * - Input: VectorEmbedding[] from optimizer
 * - Output: ValidationResults with quality assessment
 * - Used by quality assurance and improvement
