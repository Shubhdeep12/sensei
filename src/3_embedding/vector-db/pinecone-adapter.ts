/**
 * PINECONE ADAPTER
 *
 * ROLE: Pinecone vector database integration and operations
 *
 * IMPORTS:
 * - Pinecone client library
 * - VectorStore interface
 * - VectorEmbedding from shared/types
 *
 * EXPORTS:
 * - PineconeAdapter class
 * - Pinecone-specific operations
 * - Connection management utilities
 *
 * PROCESS:
 * 1. Connects to Pinecone vector database
 * 2. Manages indexes and namespaces
 * 3. Handles vector operations (store, retrieve, search)
 * 4. Manages metadata and filtering
 * 5. Provides Pinecone-specific optimizations
 *
 * PINECONE FEATURES:
 * - Managed vector database service
 * - High-performance similarity search
 * - Metadata filtering
 * - Namespace organization
 * - Real-time updates
 * - Scalable infrastructure
 *
 * OPERATIONS:
 * - Index Management: Create, update, delete indexes
 * - Vector Operations: Upsert, query, delete vectors
 * - Metadata Filtering: Filter by metadata
 * - Namespace Management: Organize vectors
 * - Batch Operations: Bulk vector operations
 *
 * USAGE:
 * - Used by VectorStore for Pinecone operations
 * - Input: VectorEmbedding[] and operations
 * - Output: Pinecone API responses
 * - Used by vector storage and retrieval
